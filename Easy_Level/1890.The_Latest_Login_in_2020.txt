# Write your MySQL query statement below


### MY APPROACH

/*WITH DT AS(SELECT user_id,MAX(time_stamp) AS time_stamp FROM Logins
GROUP BY time_stamp
HAVING YEAR(time_stamp) =2020

)
SELECT user_id, MAX(time_stamp) AS last_stamp FROM DT 
GROUP BY user_id
 ;
 */

 #BELOW OPTIMIZED APPROACH

SELECT user_id, MAX(time_stamp) AS last_stamp
FROM Logins
WHERE YEAR(time_stamp) = 2020
GROUP BY user_id

## WINDOW FUNCTION
/*
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct user_id, first_value(time_stamp) over(partition by user_id order by time_stamp desc) as last_stamp from Logins where year(time_stamp)='2020'*/
