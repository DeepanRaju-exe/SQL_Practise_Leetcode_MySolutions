# Please write a DELETE statement and DO NOT write a SELECT statement.
# Write your MySQL query statement below

# by using with clause for deleting by sybquerry wrap it  up with another select querry

/*
WITH S as (
SELECT e.id from Person as e
JOIN  Person as a on e.email=a.email

/*DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id IN (SELECT id 
FROM (SELECT e.id from Person as e

#approach 2 Fast
/*WITH S as (
SELECT e.id from Person as e
JOIN  Person as a on e.email=a.email
WHERE e.id > a.id)
DELETE  FROM Person
WHERE id in (SELECT id FROM  S);*/

#correct approach  which will work for more duplicate entries above querry work only for 2 entry

/*
Select * FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM (
SELECT MIN(id) as id
FROM Person
Group by email) x);
*/

DELETE  FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM (
SELECT MIN(id) as id
FROM Person
Group by email) x);
