# Write your MySQL query statement below

######BEST APPROACH
 /*Write your T-SQL query statement below 

SELECT DISTINCT A.product_id, B.product_name
FROM Sales A LEFT JOIN Product B ON A.product_id = B.product_id LEFT JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM Sales WHERE sale_date not between '2019-01-01' and '2019-03-31') C ON A.product_id = C.product_id
WHERE C.product_id is null*/
