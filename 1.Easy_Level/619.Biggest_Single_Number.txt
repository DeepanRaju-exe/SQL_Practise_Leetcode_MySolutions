# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    MAX(num) AS num
FROM
    (SELECT
        num
    FROM
        MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(num) = 1) AS t;

###MY APPROACH #########

/*WITH SS AS (SELECT *
FROM MyNumbers
GROUP BY num
HAVING COUNT(num) =1
ORDER BY num DESC 
LIMIT 1
)

SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(*) =0 THEN 'null'ELSE num  END AS num FROM SS ;
