# Write your MySQL query statement below
#my solution
WITH SS AS 
(SELECT E.*, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY E.SCORE DESC) AS rank1
 FROM Scores AS E) 
SELECT score, rank1 AS 'rank' FROM SS;


# like countig number if rank is 2 means there is only 2 which is below than that that is itself and rank 1. using this logic below solution .

## approach 2
/*
SELECT
  S1.score,
  (
    SELECT
      COUNT(DISTINCT S2.score)
    FROM
      Scores S2
    WHERE
      S2.score >= S1.score
  ) AS 'rank'
FROM
  Scores S1
ORDER BY
  S1.score DESC;
  */

  ## Approach 3 ##

/*
SELECT
  S.score,
  COUNT(DISTINCT T.score) AS 'rank'
FROM
  Scores S
  INNER JOIN Scores T ON S.score <= T.score
GROUP BY
  S.id,
  S.score
ORDER BY
  S.score DESC;*/
